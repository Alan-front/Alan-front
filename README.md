# Hello, I'm Alan!
I'm a **frontend developer** currently working with JavaScript, Vue.js and other web technologies.  
I love creating interfaces with **smooth animations** and interactivity that surprise and improve user experience.

## About me
- I have worked on systems for construction companies, and now I'm focused on projects related to **video generators and animations**.  
- My specialty is creating custom generators using libraries like jsPDF, Chart.js, Anime.js and other tools for animations.  
- I currently have my Software Engineering degree with specialization in Artificial Intelligence on pause, but I will resume it soon.  
- I have also trained in UX/UI to design experiences that truly connect with people.  
- I like conversations that feel like a dose of caffeine — those that motivate you to keep going and create new things.
